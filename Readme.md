# 🌐 CS Network Labs

Hey! 👋
This repo is where I’m dumping all the code and experiments I do for my **Computer Networks lab** in my CS course. Everything from basic setups to advanced socket programming (and whatever else comes up) will go here.

## 📁 Structure

Each lab or experiment will have its own folder or file.
Expect things like:

* Client-server models (in C/C++)
* Socket programming examples
* Protocol simulation stuff
* Any tools/scripts/snippets we use in lab
* Maybe some notes or outputs too

Basically, if I coded it during Net lab, it’s probably here.

## 🛠 How to Use

Navigate to the folder you want, compile, and run:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

> Or use `g++` for `.cpp` files. Make sure required ports aren’t blocked and run server/client files in separate terminals.

## ✏️ Contributing (if you're me in the future)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added LabX client-server example"
git push origin main
```
